# Youtube Habit Killer

As the title implies. The program is a .pyw, so it won't open a window to annoy you (although you have to close it through task manager, so is it actually not being annoying?). The program will detect whether or not your focused window is a tab of Youtube in Chrome every five seconds. If so, it would input the keybind "Ctrl" + "W", which is a common browser keybind of closing a tab. This code is very simplistic and can be modified in mulitple ways, so take a crack at it!
